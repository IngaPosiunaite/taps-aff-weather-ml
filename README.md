“Taps aff” is a Scottish phrase meaning “tops off”, commonly used when the weather is unusually warm.

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a day in Glasgow is a “taps aff” day based on historical weather data.

## Overview

The project applies regression and binary classification to estimate missing weather values and predict warm days between 2023 and 2025. It follows a complete machine learning workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Approach

- Predict missing weather values using a regression model  
- Engineer date features to capture seasonal patterns  
- Merge weather data with labeled “taps aff” records  
- Train a binary classification model to predict warm days  
- Evaluate model performance using test data  

## What I Learned

- Handling missing data with regression  
- Feature engineering for time-based data  
- Training and evaluating classification models  
- Working with real-world weather datasets  

## Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn
